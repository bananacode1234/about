<h1>About us.</h1><br><br><br>
  <p>Hello, as you probably already know; I'm bananacode1234 and I coded this website with my friend...</p>
  <p id="p" style="display: none">Hi im bananacode's friend (Loïc)!
If you are wondering if this is ever going to be an actual website, I think I'm also speaking for my friend bananacode, it might, but for now, it's just a website that bananacode and I are having fun with.
By the way booga master codes everything and I mostly come up with the ideas.

Ok enough about booga master and me, let's talk more about the website.
This is a website where you can check what booga master and I did or <a href="https://bananacode1234.github.io/idea">send some ideas for the website</a>.

Ooga master and I are trying to update the website monthly or so (but it's kinda hard to code all of these things so don't expect new things every month).
